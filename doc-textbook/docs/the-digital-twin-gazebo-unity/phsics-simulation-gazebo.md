# Physics Simulation & Environment Building in Gazebo

Gazebo is one of the most widely used physics engines in robotics research.  
It allows students to build worlds, test robots, and analyze motion in a safe, controlled environment.

## Why We Use Gazebo in Physical AI

Gazebo provides:

- Full rigid-body physics  
- Gravity and collision simulation  
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, IMU, cameras)  
- Integration with ROS 2  
- Real-time debugging  
- Rapid prototyping of robot motion  

Humanoid robotics especially depends on:

- Balance analysis  
- Joint torque simulation  
- Contact between feet and ground  
- Fall detection  
- Gait prediction
