# Module: 2 The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

A *digital twin* is a physics-accurate virtual clone of a real robot.  
In Physical AI, digital twins allow students to:

- Test locomotion before running it on a real robot  
- Validate planning algorithms without risking hardware  
- Simulate collisions, gravity, and physical forces  
- Train AI systems using photorealistic environments  

This module covers **Gazebo** for physics simulation and **Unity** for high-fidelity visualization and human-robot interaction.

### By the end of Module 2, you will be able to:

- Build environments and worlds inside Gazebo  
- Understand rigid body physics, gravity, inertia & collisions  
- Create interactive worlds in Unity  
- Simulate LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs  
- Design a complete digital twin pipeline for humanoids
