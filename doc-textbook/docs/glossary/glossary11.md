# Glossary

- **ROS 2**: Robot Operating System 2, middleware for robotics that supports modular robot software architecture.
- **VLA**: Vision-Language-Action — integrating perception, language understanding, and action planning in robotics.
- **Whisper**: OpenAI’s speech-to-text model used to convert voice commands into text for robots.
- **Cognitive Planning**: Using AI to translate high-level instructions into sequences of executable robot actions.
- **Humanoid Robot**: A robot designed to resemble and perform tasks similar to a human.
- **Simulated Environment**: A virtual setting where robot behaviors can be tested before deploying in the real world.
- **ROS 2 Nodes**: Independent software components in ROS 2 that perform specific robot functions.
- **Topics**: Channels in ROS 2 for sending and receiving messages between nodes.
- **Actions**: Commands that trigger robot behaviors over time, often with feedback.
- **Capstone Project**: A final integrative project demonstrating mastery of concepts, e.g., autonomous humanoid completing voice commands.
- **Edge AI**: Running AI computations directly on local devices (like Jetson) rather than relying on cloud servers.
- **Path Planning**: Calculating a sequence of movements for a robot to reach a target without collisions.
