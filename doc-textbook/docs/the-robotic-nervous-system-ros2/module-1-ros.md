# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces the communication backbone of every modern robot—ROS 2.  
In humanoid robots, ROS 2 functions like a biological nervous system that carries signals between perception, planning, and motion.

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- Why robots need a nervous system  
- The role of ROS 2 as middleware  
- How ROS 2 enables communication through nodes, topics, services, and actions  
- How Python agents interface with ROS controllers  
- How humanoid bodies are represented using URDF
