# Module: 3 The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Modern humanoid robots rely on advanced perception, mapping, and planning systems.
Module 3 introduces NVIDIA Isaac™—a powerful robotics platform combining:

- Photorealistic simulation  
- Synthetic dataset generation  
- GPU-accelerated robot perception  
- VSLAM & Navigation  
- AI-enhanced sensor processing  

With Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS, students learn how to design autonomous robot brains
that see, understand, map, and navigate complex environments.

### In Module 3, you will learn:

- How to use **Isaac Sim** for synthetic data generation and photorealistic scenes  
- How **Isaac ROS** accelerates vision pipelines on Jetson / GPU systems  
- How **VSLAM** enables humanoids to understand 3D space  
- How **Nav2** computes bipedal-safe paths through dynamic environments  
- How perception and navigation combine into a full autonomy stack
