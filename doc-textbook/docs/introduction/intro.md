# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: The AI-Native Curriculum

Embark on a unique educational journey with the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course. This curriculum is designed as an AI-first, project-based intensive, empowering you to master the full stack of embodied intelligence, from establishing the foundational ROS 2 "nervous system" and creating high-fidelity digital twins in Isaac Sim, all the way through to deploying cutting-edge Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on real-world edge devices.

This textbook covers core concepts including:

*   **ROS 2** (The Robotic Nervous System)
*   **Digital Twins** (Simulation with Gazebo & Unity)
*   **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** systems
*   **Embodied AI** and Cognitive Planning
*   **Hardware Integration** (Edge AI and RealSense)
*   **Humanoid Mechanics** (Kinematics, Locomotion, Manipulation)
*   **Project Capstone:** Developing an Autonomous Humanoid Agent

To begin exploring the content, utilize the sidebar navigation. Within each dedicated module, you will find comprehensive theoretical discussions, intuitive conceptual diagrams, practical design patterns, and detailed, non-executable procedures for hands-on laboratory exercises and critical demonstrations.
