# Module: 4 Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent the frontier of Physical AI.  
They allow robots to understand human language, interpret visual scenes, and generate actions—closing the loop between perception, reasoning, and control.

In Module 4, you will learn how:

- LLMs interpret high-level instructions  
- Whisper processes real-time voice commands  
- Cognitive planners translate language into ROS 2 actions  
- VLA systems combine vision, language, and control  
- A humanoid robot becomes fully autonomous in simulation  

This final module ties the entire course together.

### By the end, you will be able to:

- Build voice interfaces using **OpenAI Whisper**  
- Use LLMs to convert tasks (“clean the room”) into action sequences  
- Connect cognitive planning pipelines with ROS 2  
- Integrate perception, mapping, and control  
- Complete the **Autonomous Humanoid Capstone Project**
